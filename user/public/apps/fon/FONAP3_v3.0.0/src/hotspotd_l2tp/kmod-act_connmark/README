act_connmark allows the use of the new and improved IFB interface
for QoS ingress traffic replacing the IMQ set of patches.

hotspotd can use either IFB or IMQ to handle incoming traffic with QoS
so if you do not have or do not want to use IMQ you have to either
patch your kernel with the given patch or build a kernel module using
the Makefile provided.

act_connmark is developed and maintained by Felix Fietkau <nbd@openwrt.org>
